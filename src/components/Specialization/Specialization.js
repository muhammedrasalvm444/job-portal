          Specialization is when a nation focuses its labor, resources, and
          capital on the production of a good or service that they are experts
          in. Trade is when nations create a relationship that promotes the
          exchange of goods and services. The bottom line: a combination of
          economies of scale, network effects and unrivaled specialization has
          made TSMC irreplaceableâ€”and has made the entire world deeply,
          precariously dependent on it.
